      Instructional designer, mentor, and software developer based in Kumasi, Ghana. I specialize in creating scaffolded learning resources for diverse learners, including ESL students and professionals seeking clarity in workplace communication. With a background in IT support and formal writing, I bring both technical precision and empathetic guidance to every project. I'm currently studying Computer Science at BYU–Idaho and actively serve as a Pathway Missionary, helping students succeed academically and spiritually.

     <img src="images/goals.webp" alt="Goals">
     <p>
     Building reusable comprehension resources and mentoring learners worldwide. My short-term focus is on refining rubric-aligned quiz sets that guide learners from literal recall to inference and synthesis. Long-term, I aim to lead global teams in instructional design, empowering others to master nuanced reading and reasoning skills. I’m passionate about feedback-driven growth, and I strive to make learning accessible, transparent, and transformative for all.
